# Tilesets

When choosing a tileset to display, the game looks in three places:

 1. The default tileset of the game. This is used for a level if no other
	tilesets are provided.
 2. The tileset of the level. If the level designer provided a tileset, use this
	one.
 3. The player's custom tileset. The player can choose a tileset to override
	any other tilesets in the game.
